## Tasks

1. Create a new supervisor user for a group of interns
    - - Create a new user with username `iamSupervisor`

## Hints

- Use IAM to create and manage AWS users groups and users permissions
- AWS supports integration of Microsof Active Directory or 3rd party Identity Providers such as Facebook and Google
- AWS Services can be accessed via Management Console, AWC CLI, or SDKs and APIs
- Manage multiple users permissions using IAM Groups to ensure that each member will be provisioned with the same permission policy
- After user authentication comes authorization for accessing services. By default IAM users cannot access anything in your account __Principle of least privilege PoLP__
